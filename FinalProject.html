<p><b><u>The Island Fish Fry</u></b>
    <br>

<br>
The Island Fish Fry occurs every Thursday from 5:30pm to 9:30pm at the Kids Park in the Lower Bight, Providenciales. The
Island Fish Fry is the most sought-after weekly event and features over a dozen restaurant and souvenir vendors, a live
band, cultural performances that come together to create an evening of “all things Turks & Caicos”.

The weekly event hosted by the Turks and Caicos Tourist Board, entices locals and visitors alike to experience an
evening of fun in a family friendly setting. The evening culminates with Junkanoo (a traditional procession of
masqueraders in costume dancing to the rhythm of drums, cowbells and other native instruments). Come and enjoy succulent
local food, great entertainment and a first-hand look at Turks & Caicos’ culture steps away from the world’s best beach
– Grace Bay.
